            <p>Jon was a nervous, young freshman sitting in the back of the school auditorium on orientation day. With all the commotion going on with all the other students just as nervous as he was, he noticed a beautiful, petite girl all the way in the front of the room. He told himself that he had to become friends with her no matter what it takes. Later in the semester, as Jon is playing loud music in his dorm room with the door open, this same girl he saw a month or so earlier barges in. She heard the music and thought that the dj had good taste. This is when Jon first met her and learned her name, Thais. Even to this day, Jon will tell Thais of the first time he saw her in the auditorium. Thais says he's full of it, but Jon swears it was love at first sight.</p>

            <p>Thais and Jon were in the pool area of a hotel in Cocoa Beach, Florida. Thais was on the female crew team and a division 1 athlete (or so she brags). Jon joined the men's crew team, which was actually just a group, so he could head to Florida for spring break. The men's team was heading down there to practice and coincidentally (or not) so was the women's team. Up to this point, Jon and Thais showed mutual interest in having a relationship. So, sitting out by the pool in the dark, they were having the discussion of taking their relationship to the next step. Jon had to ask what the next step was but quickly agreed. Friends would later start taking bets on how long these two would stay together as a couple.</p>

            <p>Tears were shed as Thais and Jon unpacked an SUV filled with Thais's belongings. She moved to Detroit to go to Law School and they would have to endure a long-distance relationship. As they spent all of their available time together in college, this would be rough for them. What was once 2 hour weekly train rides during school breaks now became 2 hour monthly flights during the whole year. This was a challenging moment in their lives, but they would prove to overcome it and have a stronger relationship because of it.</p>

            <p>Again tears were shed; however, this time, they were tears of joy. Thais finally moved back to the East coast and moved in with Jon. He was happy to fly out there and take the 14 hour drive with all her belongings (which he would do a 100 times more if he had to). As Jon is walking with her to the apartment, they make a promise to each other to never be apart again.</p>

            <p>Laying on the grass in Central Park, Jon and Thais are listening to the ruckus caused by the St. Patty's parade. Their anniversary happens to fall on the same day so they're used to the commotion. Celebrating their 8 year anniversary with a picnic in the park, Jon's heart is beating so hard that he fears Thais can hear it over the noise. The engagement ring in his pocket (which Thais almost discovered on their way there) is burning a whole in his chest. Finally, he gets the courage to propose and Thais's reply is "Are you serious?". Jon had to make sure she meant yes, but after that confusion was cleared up they called everyone in their families to tell them the great news.</p>

            <p>Now this hasn't happened just yet, but the day is sneaking up on them faster than they would have thought. There's been over a year of planning going into this and many emails, phone calls (and checks). No matter the outcome, Thais and Jon are sure to enjoy themselves especially with all the great company they'll have. It's sure to be the worse day of their marriage as everyday they're husband and wife will be better than the one before.</p>

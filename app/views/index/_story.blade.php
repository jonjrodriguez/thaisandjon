            <p>Jon was a nervous, young freshman sitting in the back of the school auditorium on orientation day.  Despite all the commotion going on in the large room filled with optimistic students, Jon noticed a beautiful, petite girl shuffle into the room.  At that instant, he told himself he had to meet that girl. Later in the semester, Jon was blasting a Sean Paul hit on his stereo in his dorm room with the door wide open.  Suddenly, the same girl he saw on the first day of college, barged into his room dancing to the reggae hit.  She heard the music and thought the “DJ” had great taste.  This was the first time Jon met the girl and learned her name, Thais.  Even to this day, Jon will tell Thais of the first time he saw her in the auditorium during orientation. Thais says he's full of it, but Jon swears it was love at first sight.</p>

            <p>On a warm, humid night in Cocoa Beach, Florida, while Thais and Jon were sitting near the edge of the hotel pool, it “became official” (whatever that meant).  It was past the athletes’ curfews, and so, the two sat and chatted quietly and inconspicuously.  Thais was a coxswain on the women’s varsity crew team and a division I athlete (or so she brags).  Jon joined the men’s club crew team so that he could head to Florida for Spring break.  The men’s club team was heading down there to practice, and coincidentally (or not) so was the women’s varsity team.  Up to this point, Jon and Thais showed mutual interest in each other, but Jon only expressed his true feelings after losing a few games of beruit.  On this night, Thais initiated a conversation about taking their relationship to the next step.  Jon asked what the next step was, and without much explanation, he quickly agreed.  Back at Fairfield, friends started taking bets on how long the two would stay together as a couple.</p>

            <p>Tears shed as Thais and Jon unpacked an SUV filled with her belongings.  She moved to Michigan to go to Law School, and the two decided to try a long-distance relationship.  During college, Thais and Jon spent most of their free time together and so this would be a challenge.  What once was a two-hour weekly train ride from New York to Connecticut became a two-hour monthly flight from New York to Michigan.  There is no doubt that this was an obstacle and tested their relationship, but Thais and Jon were committed to each other and to making their relationship work.  The two worked hard to overcome the hurdles long-distance presented and appreciate that it made their relationship stronger.</p>

            <p>Again, tears shed; however, this time, they were tears of joy.  Thais finally moved back to the East coast and moved in with Jon.  He was happy and more than willing to fly out to Michigan to help Thais pack her Chevy Aveo and U-Haul truck, and drive 14 hours back to New York (which he would do a 100 times over if he had to). As they unload the last bag and walk into their apartment, Jon and Thais make a promise to each other to never be apart again.</p>

            <p>Laying on the grass in Central Park, Jon and Thais are listening to the ruckus caused by the St. Patty's Day parade. Their anniversary happens to fall on the same day, so they're accustomed to the commotion.  Celebrating their 8 year anniversary with a picnic in the beautiful park, Jon's heart is beating so hard that he fears Thais can hear it over the noise.  The engagement ring in his pocket (which Thais almost discovered on their way there) is burning a hole in his pocket.  Finally, he musters up the courage to propose. Thais replied, "Are you serious?" and the tears followed.  While the two had discussed their future together, she did not expect Jon to propose at the moment.  Jon was a bit perplexed by her initial response, and so he asked again.  Thais immediately said, “Of course! Yes!” and embraced Jon.  After the confusion was cleared up, they called their families to share the news.</p>

            <p>Now this hasn't happened just yet, but the day is sneaking up on them faster than they anticipated. There's been over a year of planning, several hundred emails and phone calls sent, and (many) checks written.  No matter the outcome, Thais and Jon are sure to enjoy themselves especially given all the great company they will have.  It is sure to be the worst day of their marriage, as everyday they are husband and wife will be better than the one before.</p>
